# 🎨 Worst Website Generator — Designer's Nightmare Edition

> *"A landing page generator built by someone who learned web design yesterday but had too much confidence."*

## 🤔 What is this?

A Next.js web application that generates intentionally terrible, humorous landing pages as a parody tool. The app creates deliberately bad websites satirizing terrible web design practices commonly seen in spammy landing pages, scam sites, and overly aggressive marketing pages.

Every design decision was made to maximise chaos: clashing neon colors that could strip paint, popup ads that fight back, forms with impossible-to-answer fields, navigation that actively refuses to help, and CTAs that lie about what they do.

And yet — somehow — it works.

## 🏆 Origin story

### The Kilo League

This project is an entry for the **[Kilo League Challenge](https://blog.kilo.ai/p/kilo-league)** —
a year-long competitive arena for AI engineering where developers master the art
of orchestrating intelligent agents rather than just writing code.

The League structure:

| Stage               | What it is                                              | Prize                            |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 🏃 Weekly Speedruns | Fast challenge rounds, new themes every week            | $1 000+ in credits & rewards     |
| 🧪 Quarterly Majors | Exclusive virtual hackathons for top earners            | TBA                              |
| 🥊 Championship     | End-of-year bracket for season qualifiers               | **$50 000 grand prize package**  |

This project was built for one of those hackathon challenges — specifically the
*"Worst Website Ever"* edition:

> 🔥 *An online hackathon where you compete to build the most
> hilariously unusable, delightfully terrible, gloriously broken website
> imaginable.*
>
> *Think: auto-playing music, mystery meat navigation, fonts that shouldn't
> exist, pop-ups inside pop-ups, and UX so bad it becomes art.*

The entire application was built using the
**[KiloCode App Builder](https://kilo.ai/appbuilder)** — without writing a
single line of code by hand at first. Pure vibecoding.

### 💡 What is vibecoding?

Vibecoding means describing what you want in plain language and letting an AI
model turn it into working code. You steer; the model drives. When the model
misunderstands (and it will), you correct the course and go again.

No boilerplate. No setup. Just prompts and vibes.

### 🤖 AI model used

The project was built using **MiniMax M2.5** (available for free inside KiloCode
at the time of development) as the primary builder for the generation logic,
chaos engine, and UI components.

## 🎛️ The generator

The platform generates deliberately bad landing pages. Users control six chaos sliders to determine how terrible their generated site will be.

### 🟢 1 — Chaos Controls

| Setting               | Description                                                          |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Visual Pain**       | Clashing neon colors, poor contrast, scanlines, jarring animations |
| **Navigation Confusion** | Hidden/disappearing nav menus, confusing labels                  |
| **Performance Nightmare** | Slow interactions, delays, annoying behaviors                    |
| **Cognitive Overload** | Excessive form fields, overwhelming information                 |
| **AI Absurdity**      | Nonsensical AI-generated content and claims                        |
| **Total Chaos**       | Overall mayhem level combining all factors                         |

### 👻 2 — Landing Page Types

- **SaaS Trial** — "Start a free trial" service pages
- **E-commerce** — Product stores with absurd items
- **Download/Training** — E-books, courses, reports
- **AI Service** — Mysterious AI-powered tools
- **Local Service** — Appointments, service bookings

### 🚀 3 — Generated Content

- **Popup Traps** — Popups that move away when you try to close them
- **Visitor Counters** — Fake counters showing "probably" online visitors
- **Absurd Forms** — Fields like "Mother's maiden meme", "IPv6 feelings"
- **Contradictory Testimonials** — Reviews that say both good and bad things
- **Confusing Pricing** — Tiers with nonsensical features
- **WeirdCAPTCHA** — Challenges with absurd instructions
- **Confusing Navigation** — Labels like "Home-ish", "Exit?", "Legal-ish"

### 🎲 Chaos Seed

Each generation uses a deterministic seed so bad designs can be reproduced. Enter a seed number to recreate a specific terrible layout.

### 🔄 Make It Worse Button

Pressing this button regenerates styles, injects more animations, adds extra popups, and randomizes the layout further.

---

## 😈 Intentionally bad features *(a non-exhaustive list)*

- 🟩 **Color scheme** — Neon gradients, low contrast text, scanlines, text shadows
  that compete with content. All at once. On every screen.
- 📢 **Popup traps** — Appear when you try to leave. The close button moves when
  you click it. *"Closing this window will open two more."*
- ⌨️ **Form fields** — Must enter "Mother's maiden meme", "IPv6 feelings",
  "Salary expectation in vibes". All fields are mandatory. Even optional ones.
- ⚡ **Sabotage events** — Buttons that move, CTAs that lie, navigation that
  actively refuses to take you where you want to go.
- 🏆 **Visitor counter** — "Human Beings Detected: probably". Updates randomly.
- 💥 **Screen effects** — Blinking, wobbling, shaking, floating. Pick several.
- 🔆 **Captcha** — "Select all images containing existential dread. Then solve
  3 riddles you haven't read yet."

## ⚙️ How the app works

Everything lives in a Next.js application with API routes for generation and preview.

```
Browser (React 19)
  │
  ├── 🎛️ Chaos Control Panel  (sliders for 6 chaos dimensions)
  ├── 🏭 Generation API  (/api/generate → seed + settings → chaos.ts)
  ├── 🎨 Chaos Engine  (deterministic RNG, palette generation, content assembly)
  ├── 📄 Preview Renderer  (generated HTML with inline styles)
  └── 📦 Export  (JSZip for downloading generated sites)
```

The core generation logic lives in `src/lib/chaos.ts` (~640 lines) — a deterministic
RNG-based engine that produces reproducible "bad" content based on seed values.

## 🔬 Assumptions & design notes

- 🎯 **Deterministic RNG** — Uses Mulberry32 for reproducible results. Same seed
  always produces the same "bad" page. This is actually useful for debugging.
- 🗂️ **Chaos settings are normalized** — All sliders clamp to 0-10 range, defaults
  are intentionally high (worst is the default).
- 📐 **Landing page types share common structure** — Features, testimonials, FAQ,
  and form sections are generated similarly but with type-specific content.
- 👾 **Palette generation** — Neon colors are selected based on page type but
  intentionally clash. Backgrounds use CSS gradients that hurt the eyes.
- 🤔 **Vibecoding has limits** — AI models are excellent at generating large
  amounts of coherent code quickly. They are less reliable at maintaining
  consistency across multiple files. Human review and targeted correction
  prompts remain necessary — especially for React hooks semantics.
