## 👁️ Additional Disclaimer

By using this software, you acknowledge and agree that:

1. **Eye strain warning**: Viewing the generated websites may cause eye strain,
   headaches, confusion, or existential dread. We are not responsible for any
   of these conditions, though we take full credit for causing them.

2. **No responsibility taken**: The authors accept no responsibility for:
   - Elevated blood pressure
   - Confusion about what you just saw
   - Questions about web design ethics
   - Sudden urge to create a better website
   - Permanent damage to your color perception

3. **The websites generated are intentionally bad**: If you use this software
   to create an actual production website and it performs poorly, that is
   entirely your fault and we warned you.

4. **May cause laughter**: Side effects include involuntary laughter, confusion,
   and showing the results to colleagues who will judge you.

5. **Not a real website builder**: This is a parody project. Please do not use
   the generated websites for any serious purpose. Seriously. We mean it.

6. **Your eyes may thank you later**: If you've read this far, we're impressed.
   Consider taking a break and looking at something peaceful, like a blank wall.

## 💜 Thank You

Thank you for choosing the Worst Website Generator. We hope your experience
